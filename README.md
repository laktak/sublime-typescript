# SublimeText TypeScript 

### TS Language Only, by ericclemmons

Install this package if you want TS language support only:

- Package Control: Add Repository"
- `https://github.com/laktak/sublime-typescript`
- Package Control: Install Package
- Install `sublime-typescript`


This is faster than the MS plugin and fits better with my workflow. 

Microsofts full plugin is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin
